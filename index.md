## hello

Welcome to my personal site! Here you will find a bunch of links to both my personal projects, professional work, and a few projects that I think are really awesome. If you just want to check out my Resume, click [here](https://github.com/russellgill/hello/blob/master/Resume_RussellGill.pdf)!

### Personal Projects

Here's all my favorite personal projects, split up between my professional github, and my personal github.

- [Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3)](https://github.com/russellgill/MachineLearningNotebooks) are a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing cool datasets and machine learning results.

- [Parkinson's Detection (Python 3)](http://127.0.0.1) toolkit based on a final project for my Computational Biology course. Using an ensemble machine learning system, trained on an open dataset, benchmarks were established to see the effectiveness of the system as a classification tool.

- [Data Structures (Golang)](https://github.com/russellgill/GoDataStrucs) are a collection of data structures (and some algorithms) worked-up in Golang. Mostly the result of self-directed learning on the topic, with some experementation thrown in the mix.

- [XInput Mapper (C#)](https://github.com/russellgill/XPadInput) is a small toolkit that allows you to map keystrokes to an XInput gamepad's output. Great tool for games that otherwise do not support gamepad input!

- [Digital Ocean Cloud CLI (Java)](http://127.0.0.1) is a minimal CLI tool for creating, viewing and destroying digital ocean virtual machines.

- [Bank Simulator (Golang)](http://127.0.0.1) API allows external software to interact with a mock bank. Part of a small personal project testing the effectiveness of trading algorithms on historic data.

### Coursework

Here's a collection of projects and assignments completed for various courses. Each specific course has it's own directory.

- [Moleculear Simulation and Computational Chemistry](http://127.0.0.1) Be advised -- there's Fortran inside.

- [Computational Tools for Biological Sciences](http://127.0.0.1) is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with assignments from this course. All notebooks are Python.

### Professional Projects

- [Artemis](https://github.com/ryanmwhitephd/artemis) is a streaming-data analytics platform built off Apahche's new Arrow data format. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for the Arrow data format, and illustrates the flexibility of Arrow.

- [Artemis-Faker](https://github.com/russellgill/Artemis-Faker) A minimal redesign based on [Daniele Faraglia's](https://github.com/joke2k) Python fake data generator using a more modern Numpy random data generator. Artemis-Faker replaces the provider class design pattern with an interface allowing random-data generation from statistical modelling code.

### Awesome Projects 

Let's check out some projects that are downright cool in one way or another.

- [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) A langage agonstic in-memory data format.
- [T-Digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest) Chunk-based descripive statistics.
- [The Open Logic Project](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic) is the Wikipedia of logic textbooks.
- [A large repo](https://github.com/subbarayudu-j/TheAlgorithms-Python) of pre-made algorithms in Python.
