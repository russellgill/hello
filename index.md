## hello

Welcome to my personal site! Here you will find a bunch of links to both my personal projects, professional work, and a few projects that I think are really awesome. If you just want to check out my Resume, click [here](https://github.com/russellgill/hello/blob/master/UpdatedResume.pdf)!

### Professional Projects

All projects listed here are either fully open source, or published with the written permission of the copyright owner.

- [Artemis (Python)](https://github.com/ryanmwhitephd/artemis) is an open-source streaming-data analytics platform built off Apahche's new Arrow data format. This project serves as a proof-of-concept for the Arrow data format, and illustrates the flexibility of Arrow. My professional work falls under the umbrella of this project's parent organization, and I have some code contributions to the main framework.

- [Artemis-Faker (Python, C, Cython)](https://github.com/russellgill/ArtemisFaker) A minimal open-source redesign based on [Daniele Faraglia's](https://github.com/joke2k) Python fake data generator using a more modern Numpy random data generator. Artemis-Faker replaces the provider class design pattern with an interface allowing random-data generation from statistical modelling code. This means you can generate *synthetic* data, not just fake data. This code sits in the Artemis Analytics ecosystem and is my core contribution to the project.


### Personal Projects

This is a collection of some of the code projects I've done in my spare time. Some of them are still under development.

#### Projects Related to Courses

Code found here is related to, or was written for my 4th year courses initially, but was later expanded on.

- [Parkinson's Detection (Python 3)](https://github.com/russellgill/ParkinsonsProject/) code based on a final project for my Computational Biology course. Using an ensemble machine learning system, trained on an open dataset, benchmarks were established to see the effectiveness of the system as a classification tool.


#### Self-Directed Projects

These projects were created in my spare time, either for fun, to learn, or solve some problem I encountered.

- [Data Structures (Golang)](https://github.com/russellgill/GoDataStrucs) are a collection of data structures (and some algorithms) worked-up in Golang. Mostly the result of self-directed learning on the topic, with some experementation thrown in the mix.

- [XInput Mapper (C#)](https://github.com/russellgill/XPadInput) is a small tool that allows you to map keystrokes to an XInput gamepad's output. Great tool for games that otherwise do not support gamepad input! A work in progress.

- [Digital Ocean Cloud CLI (Java)](https://github.com/russellgill/DigitalOceanCLI) is a minimal CLI tool for creating, viewing and destroying digital ocean virtual machines.

- [Bank Simulator (Golang)](https://github.com/russellgill/BankAPI) API allows external software to interact with a mock bank. Part of a small personal project testing the effectiveness of trading algorithms on historic data.


- [Color Corrector (Python)](https://github.com/russellgill/ColorCorrector) is a tool I built to adjust my screen color settings, essentially a GUI for Gnome's display color CLI.

### Coursework

Here's a collection of projects and assignments completed for various courses. Each specific course has it's own directory containing a conglomerate of code in various languages. As of now, these are rather messy repos, and will be expanded/updated over the next few weeks.

- [Moleculear Simulation and Computational Chemistry](https://github.com/russellgill/MoleculearSimulation) Be advised -- there's Fortran inside. 

- [Computational Tools for Biological Sciences](https://github.com/russellgill/ComputationalBiology) is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks with assignments from this course. All notebooks are Python.

### Experements and Testing

Not all projects get to a fully developed state, and sometimes it's just fun to try something new. Here you will find a collection of experiments, usually less than a hundred lines of code. This is a collection of code gists and repos that I had some fun with.

- [Scraping a website](https://gist.github.com/russellgill/855469b0ccf77fc7deef9088d9b03b5a) about mythical creatures, then using a support-vector machine to sort the text into junk text vs interesting things to read.

- [Machine Learning Jupyter Notebooks (Python 3)](https://github.com/russellgill/MachineLearningNotebooks) are a collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing cool datasets and machine learning results. Not particularily strucured.

- [Analysis of various silver (XAG) ETFs](https://gist.github.com/russellgill/fafa57805cefa4da8188f7a562d449da) using Monte Carlo simulations, as well as accounting for inflation. 

- [Synthetic Data Generation experement](https://gist.github.com/russellgill/9bebd703718d3a5bf81d54e0bc332dc2#file-tinkeringwithsimulation-ipynb) using a neural net and random sampelling approach. The most overkill way to simulate a linear system with increasing entropy.

- [Python workshop](https://github.com/russellgill/SPS_Python_Workshop/tree/master) I delivered for the UOttawa Physics Society.

- [Golang Web-Assembly](https://gist.github.com/russellgill/e40b56856590e2d2be26afabd55e627f) is a very small experement on the new syscall/js module in Golang. What more could you want than being able to call Go from Javascript?

### Awesome Projects 

Let's check out some projects that are downright cool in one way or another.

- [Apache Arrow](https://github.com/apache/arrow) A langage agonstic in-memory data format.
- [T-Digest](https://github.com/tdunning/t-digest) Chunk-based descripive statistics.
- [The Open Logic Project](https://github.com/OpenLogicProject/OpenLogic) is the Wikipedia of logic textbooks.
- [A large repo](https://github.com/subbarayudu-j/TheAlgorithms-Python) of pre-made algorithms in Python.
